## Issues

When you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/kqnade/vrc-auto-exif/issues).
Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and any relevant screenshots or logs.

## Pull Requests

If you would like to contribute code to this project, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages. (More information in [commits section](#commits).)
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request against the `dev` branch of the original repository.
6. In the pull request description, explain your changes and why they are necessary.
7. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes all tests.
8. Wait for feedback from the project maintainers. Be prepared to make additional changes based on their suggestions.

## Commits

When making commits, please follow these guidelines:
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.
- Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to categorize your commits. For example:
  - `:bug:` for bug fixes
  - `:sparkles:` for new features
  - `:memo:` for documentation changes
- Use the present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Keep commit messages concise, ideally under 50 characters for the subject line.
- If the commit is related to an issue, include the issue number in the commit message (e.g., "Fix #123").
- Avoid committing large binary files or sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).

## Code Style

Please follow the project's coding style and conventions. This includes:
- Using consistent indentation (in this project, we use 2 spaces for indentation and no tabs).
- Writing clean and readable code.
- Using meaningful variable and function names.
- Writing clear and concise comments where necessary.
- Keeping lines of code within a reasonable length (e.g., 80-100 characters).
- Using consistent naming conventions (in this project, we use PascalCase for classes and camelCase for variables and functions).
- Using proper error handling and logging practices.
- Writing unit tests for new features or bug fixes, if applicable.
- Ensuring that your code passes all existing tests and does not introduce new issues.

## Documentation

Please ensure that any new features or changes to existing functionality are documented in the project's documentation. This includes:
- Updating the README file with any new instructions or information.
- Adding comments to your code to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- If applicable, updating any relevant API documentation or user guides.
